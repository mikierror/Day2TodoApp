# 🚀 Day 2 of My 15-Day Machine Coding Challenge

## 📝 Todo App with Filter Tags & LocalStorage

This is a simple, clean **React Todo App** where users can:

✅ Add Todos  
🏷️ Tag them as "Work" or "Personal"  
🔍 Filter by tags (Work, Personal, All)  
✏️ Edit todos  
☑️ Mark as complete  
🗑️ Delete tasks  
💾 **All data is stored in localStorage** (persists across refreshes)

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Tag-Based Filtering** – Filter your tasks by their purpose  
- **Live Editing** – Edit a task's name without refreshing the page  
- **Local Storage** – Tasks stay saved even after you close the browser  
- **Toasts & Validations** – Handles blank input with user feedback
